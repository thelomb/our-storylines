# Ideas and Next Development Steps

## Bug
last seen not working

## Next Development
- rework the login so that index is public
- manage google location API errors (offline, etc.)
- image page with navigation
- if no storyline (technically possible), redirect to user page instead of 404

## Ideas
- For at-friends stay the people we meet (with pictures)
- Stay description
- link picture to map (click on picture map focus on geopoint)
- commenting
- followers vs contributors
- send invite
- text area size with javascript
