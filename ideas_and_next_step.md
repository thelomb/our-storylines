# Ideas and Next Development Steps

## Next Development
- refactor distance in itinerary model
- storyline: nb days, cumul km
- color scheme: saturated colors
- single entry per day
- rework the login so that index is public
- manage google location API errors (offline, etc.)
- image page with navigation
- photo legend
-- model: legend
-- service: load comment by image (-> nothing to do?)
-- service: save comment -> extend media init with comment
-- route: load (if anyhting)
-- route: update -> get comment in form by picture id
-- edit_story: allow change name? modifyadd comment
-- view_story: find a way to nicely display the comment (under pix?)

## Ideas
